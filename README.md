This repo will have all the material related to Natural Language Processing. Initially I have started with practicing all the topics which includes the 
definition and small explanation along with the code for that particular topic on a sample corpus. 

There will be multiple resources used while creating this repository like youtube videos, Chatgpt, material from different blogs like medium, Analytics Vidhya etc.
